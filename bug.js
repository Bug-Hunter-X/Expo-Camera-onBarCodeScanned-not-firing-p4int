This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom `onBarCodeScanned` function. The issue is that the `onBarCodeScanned` function is not triggered when a barcode is scanned, even though the camera is correctly displaying the preview and the barcode is clearly visible. This is likely caused by a mismatch in the expected data format or a failure to properly register the callback function.
